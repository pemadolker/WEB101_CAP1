# Pokédex
 This is a simple web application that lets you search for and view information about Pokémon.

## Features

### 1. Search
- Type the name of a Pokémon into the search bar and press Enter to find it.
- If the Pokémon exists, its details will be displayed on the page.
- If the Pokémon does not exist, an alert will notify the user.

### 2. Pagination
- As you scroll down the page, more Pokémon will be loaded automatically.
- This allows you to browse through a large number of Pokémon without overwhelming the page.

### 3. Favorite Pokémon
- Click the heart button on a Pokémon card to mark it as a favorite.
- The heart button toggles between "Add to Favorites" and "Remove from Favorites" based on the current status.
- The list of favorite Pokémon is stored locally, so it persists even if you refresh the page.

### 4. Responsive Design
- The app is designed to work well on all devices, including phones and computers.
- The layout adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent user experience.
